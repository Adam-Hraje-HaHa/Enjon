KEY_CODES: 
	- √ : ALT + 251

TODO:

Collisions:
	- Set up quadtrees/BSP √
	- Establish appropriate hit boxes for enemies and characters based on AABB struct
	- Create AABB struct and place in either Transform system or a different physics system	
	- Different weapons will have different hit boxes
	- Refactor collision code even more

Animations: 
	- Full character animation set for testing (Walking, Attacking)
	- Full enemy animation set for testing (Walking, Attacking)

SpriteBatch:
	- Add Mask to each vertex for shader effects when rendering so to avoid using unnecessary shaders

Game Design:
	- Create overall game design flowchart
	- Implement myself as a mini-boss (game programmer boss!)

GamePlay: 
	- Design target system for ranged weapons

Systems: 
	- General:
		- Separate characters into layers: head gear, armor, legs, weapons, etc.

	- Effects:
		- Develop particle engine
	
	- AIController:
		- Look up and set Behavior Trees for entities

	- Renderer2D:
		- Set up rendering system
		- Renderer components will keep track of sprite batch pointers
		- Set up SpriteBatch manager
		- PostProcessing: 
			- Post Processing wraps the rendering code
			- Set up FrameBuffer to be written to and read from
